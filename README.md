Project Overview
This project uses Next.js, a React framework optimized for building fast, user-friendly web applications. I've implemented both client and server-side rendering, data fetching, and several reusable components following the Atomic Design Principles. Might look a little bit messy but that's because I've tried to showcase different styles of handling css, folder structures.
